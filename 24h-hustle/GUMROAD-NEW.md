## 🎓 How The Auto-Generation Works

### The Formula Chain

```
Database: Invoices
├── Hours (you enter: 25)
├── Rate (auto-fills: from Client = $150)
├── Subtotal (formula: Hours × Rate = $3,750)
├── Tax Rate (you enter: 0.08 or 0)
├── Tax Amount (formula: Subtotal × Tax Rate)
└── Total (formula: Subtotal + Tax = Final)
```

**You enter: Hours**
**You get: Complete invoice totals, automatically**

### Linked Data Flow

```
Client: Sarah Chen ($150/hr)
  ↓ Linked
Projects: Landing Page ($5,000), Dashboard UX ($8,000)
  ↓ Linked
Invoices: INV-001 ($3,750 ✅), INV-008 ($4,500 📤)
  ↓ Rolls up
Dashboard: Revenue $8,250, Outstanding $4,500
```

**Change a client's rate → Future invoices update automatically.**
