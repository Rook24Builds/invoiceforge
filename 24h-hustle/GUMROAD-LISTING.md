# INVOICEFORGE

## Auto-Generate Invoices From Your Notion Work Log

**Itemized billing. Auto-calculations. One-click PDF automation.**

Not a blank template. Linked databases (Work Log → Invoices) create detailed line items. Import Make scenario → Status "Sent" triggers PDF generation automatically.

---

## ✨ What Makes This Different

**Most Notion templates:** Empty pages, manual calculations, isolated data.

**INVOICEFORGE:**
- Pre-populated (5 clients, 8 projects, 10 invoices)
- Work Log tracks tasks → auto-calculates amounts
- Link entries to Invoices → creates itemized line items
- **Import Make scenario → PDF generates when Status = "Sent"**
