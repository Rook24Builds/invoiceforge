# INVOICEFORGE

## Auto-Generate Invoices From Your Notion Work Log

**Itemized billing. Auto-calculated totals. PDF generation via free automation.**

This isn't another blank template. It links Work Log entries → Invoices for detailed line items. Complete with pre-populated data and Make.com integration.

---

## ✨ What Makes This Different

**Most Notion templates:** Empty pages that don't connect invoicing to actual work tracking.

**INVOICEFORGE:**
- Work Log tracks tasks/hours (with auto-calc)
- Link entries to Invoices (creates line items)
- Invoice totals roll up from linked work
- Change Status → Make generates PDF
