**Title:** I built a Notion template to stop losing track of client invoices — $19

**Body:**
```
I got tired of juggling 5+ clients in spreadsheets and forgetting who owed me money.

So I built this Notion template with linked databases for:
• Clients (lifetime value, status, contact info)
• Projects (deadlines, budgets, linked to clients)  
• Invoices (sent/paid/overdue, linked to projects)

**Includes:**
✅ Notion template (duplicate in 10 seconds)
✅ 3 Canva invoice templates (clean, bold, minimal)
✅ 5-min setup guide

**Price:** $19

Buy if it saves you time. Roast me if it doesn't. Either way I learn something.

## Post 2: r/Notion (150k members)

**Title:** Built a client management system for freelancers — looking for feedback

**Body:**
```
I made a Notion template specifically for freelancers tracking multiple clients and invoices.

Features:
- 3 linked databases (Clients → Projects → Invoices)
- Auto-calculated lifetime value per client
- Invoice status tracking (Draft/Sent/Paid/Overdue)
- Kanban + Calendar views for projects

Also threw in 3 Canva invoice templates because why not.

**What do y'all think?**

Good enough to charge $19 for, or should I make it free?

**Title:** 24-hour challenge: Built a $19 product, launching today

**Body:**
```
Challenge myself to ship something in 24 hours that actually solves a real problem.

**The problem:** Freelancers juggling clients in spreadsheets, losing track of invoices

**The solution:** Notion template + invoice templates for $19

**Time breakdown:**
- 2 hrs: Built Notion databases
- 1 hr: Wrote copy & setup guide  
- 1 hr: Generated thumbnail, set up Gumroad
- Next: Post to Reddit and see if anyone buys

**The goal:** 1 sale to validate it's worth building more

If you're a freelancer, would you pay $19 for this?

(Brutal honesty welcome — learning here)
