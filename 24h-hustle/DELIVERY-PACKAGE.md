### Post Template (Reddit):

**Subject:** I built a Notion template to stop losing track of client invoices — $19 (or roast me, free)

**Body:**
```
I got tired of juggling 5+ clients in spreadsheets and forgetting who owed me money.

Built this Notion template with linked databases for:
- Clients (lifetime value, status, notes)
- Projects (deadlines, budgets, linked to clients)  
- Invoices (sent/paid/overdue, linked to projects)

**Includes:**
✅ Notion template (duplicate in 10 seconds)
✅ 3 Canva invoice templates (clean, bold, minimal styles)
✅ Setup guide

**Price:** $19 (cheaper than one hour of your time to build it)

**The deal:** Buy it if it saves you time. Roast me in the comments if it doesn't. Either way, I learn something.

Link in comments if interested.
