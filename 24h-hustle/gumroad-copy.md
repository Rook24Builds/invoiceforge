**Freelancer Command Center** — Stop Juggling Clients in Your Head

## Headline
The simple Notion system that helps freelancers track clients, projects, and invoices — all in one place.

## Description
You're 3 clients deep and suddenly you can't remember:
- Which client owes you money?
- When is Project X due?

**The Freelancer Command Center fixes this.**

### What's Inside:
✅ **Client Hub** — Every client, their status, lifetime value, contact info  
✅ **Project Tracker** — Active projects, deadlines, status, linked to clients  
✅ **Invoice Manager** — What's sent, what's paid, what's overdue  
✅ **Revenue Dashboard** — Monthly view of money in/money out  
✅ **Quick Actions** — Log a call, send a follow-up, invoice instantly
