## Tweet 2/5 — The Problem
Most freelancers invoice like this:

Notion → Sheets → Canva → Gmail

15 minutes. Every. Single. Invoice.

Or worse: You don't invoice promptly because it's a hassle.

→ Cash flow problems
→ Awkward follow-ups
→ Lost revenue

## Tweet 3/5 — The Solution (The 60-Second Workflow)
INVOICEFORGE cuts that to 60 seconds:

1. Enter hours worked
2. Rate auto-fills from client record
3. Total calculates automatically
4. Export PDF
5. Send

No copy-pasting.
No app-switching.
No manual math.

## Tweet 4/5 — The Value (ROI Focus)
Save 2 hours/month × $50/hour = $100/month value

Cost: $19 one-time

Payback time: 12 minutes of use

Plus: Pre-populated data means you understand it in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.

## Tweet 5/5 — The Offer + Build in Public
$19 one-time. No subscription. No hidden costs.
