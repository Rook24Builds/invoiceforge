# I Built a $19 Product in 2 Hours for 2.5 Cents — Here's the Stack

**The constraint was simple:** Ship something today. Spend less than a dime. Make it useful enough that someone would pay for it.

I'm not special. I just get restless.

## The $0.025 Experiment

Most of us have a graveyard of half-finished projects. I wanted to bury something *finished*.

**The rules:**
- ⏰ 2 hours max
- 💰 $0.10 budget
- 🎯 Must solve a real problem
- 🚀 Must be shippable (payment, delivery, the works)

## The Problem: Freelancer Chaos

Like most freelancers, I was drowning in app sprawl:

- **Notion** for project notes
- **Google Sheets** for invoices (don't @ me)
- **Docs** for contracts
- **Airtable** for client tracking (for like 2 weeks)
- **Canva** for branded invoices
- **Streak** in Gmail for pipeline management (crashed and burned)

Every month: 2-3 hours just organizing client info across 5+ apps. Multiply that by 12 months. That's a solid work week gone.

Not from *doing* work — from *organizing* the work I was supposed to do.

## The Constraint-forced Solution

**If I can't ship it in 2 hours, I'm overthinking it.**

So I built something stupidly simple:

→ **One Notion template** with 3 linked databases (Clients → Projects → Invoices)

→ **3 Canva invoice templates** for consistent branding

→ **One Gumroad listing** ($19, instant digital delivery)

→ **One AI-generated thumbnail** (Flux 2 Pro on KIE.ai — *that's* where the $0.025 went)

**No custom code. No hosting fees. No monthly subscriptions.**

## The Build Breakdown

| Component | Tool | Cost | Time |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| Product | Notion template | Free | 45 min |
| Invoices | Canva templates | Free | 30 min |
| Checkout | Gumroad | Free + 10% fee | 15 min |
| Thumbnail | KIE.ai (Flux 2 Pro) | $0.025 | 5 min |
| **Total** | | **$0.025** | **1h 55m** |

**The Notion structure:**
- **Clients DB:** Contact info, rates, contract dates, status
- **Projects DB:** Linked to clients, status, deadlines, deliverables
- **Invoices DB:** Linked to projects, auto-populated client data, payment status

**Why this matters:** One change in the Clients table propagates everywhere. Update a client's address? Every future invoice updates automatically.

## The $19 Price Point

I didn't want to think about pricing for 30 minutes. Two numbers came to mind:

- **$9:** Too cheap. Screams "I don't value this"
- **$29:** Getting into "serious tool" territory
- **$19:** The "coffee and a pastry" price

At $19, the value proposition is obvious: *Spend 2 hours setting this up once, or pay $19 and start using it in 5 minutes.*

Anyone who's wasted a Friday afternoon wrestling with invoice formatting gets it instantly.

## What Constraints Actually Do

There's this myth that you need *more* resources to build better products.

**Reality:** Constraints force clarity.

With 2 hours and 2.5 cents:
- I couldn't build a custom web app
- I couldn't integrate 6 different APIs
- I couldn't "just quickly" add one more feature

I had to ship the *smallest version* that solved the *real problem*.

**That's the entire product.** Notion template + invoices. That's it.

The moment I tried to add "just one more thing" — a client portal, a time tracker, an automation — was the moment I had to say: *"That's Product 2.0. This is Product 1.0."*

## The Launch

Shipped to:
- Twitter/X (@Rook24Builds)
- LinkedIn (build-in-public post)
- Indie Hackers (Show IH)
- Hacker News (Show HN)
- Reddit (r/freelance)

**Total marketing time:** Another hour (mostly copy-pasting the same story, slightly adapted).

**Total investment:** $0.025 + 3 hours of actual work.

## The "So What?" Test

Here's the uncomfortable question: *Why does this matter?*

Because most people think they need:
- VC funding
- A dev team
- 6 months of runway
- A perfect product

**You don't.** You need:
- 2 hours of focused work
- A real problem you've experienced
- A willingness to ship imperfect work
- The humility to charge $19, not $1999

That's it.

## The Product

If you're a freelancer still juggling 5 apps just to send an invoice, this might save you a week's worth of administrative labor per year.

## The Challenge

**What could you build in 2 hours with $0.10?**

Not "what's your dream product." Not "what would you build if you had unlimited time and money."

What could you ship *today*?

Drop a comment. Or better — ship it and tag me. I'll be watching.
