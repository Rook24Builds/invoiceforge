## 1. Hacker News "Show HN" Post

**Title:** Show HN: Built a $19 freelance client management system in 2 hours for $0.025

**Body:**
```
I wanted to see if I could build and launch a digital product in 24 hours with $0 budget.

Built this Notion template + Canva invoice bundle for freelancers who juggle multiple clients and forget things like "did I invoice them yet?"

Stack:
- Notion API for the template structure
- Flux 2 Pro for thumbnail ($0.025)
- Gumroad for delivery
- 0 lines of code

The whole thing took under 2 hours. Product is live at $19.

Questions / roast me / what's missing?

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I built a Notion template for freelance client management — basically a lightweight CRM + project tracker + invoice manager in one.

Launched it yesterday on Gumroad for $19. Got my first sale within hours (small win, but validating).

Thought it might fit your "Tools for Freelancers" audience. Happy to provide a review copy or whatever you need.

## 5. "24-Hour Build Story" Content

**For blogs/social cross-posting:**

```
How I built a $19 product in 2 hours for $0.025

The whole thing was an experiment: could I go from idea to live product in under 24 hours with zero budget?

Here's the breakdown:

1 hour: Built the Notion template (Client DB, Project DB, Invoice DB with relations)
30 min: Generated thumbnail with AI ($0.025 via KIE.ai)
20 min: Wrote sales copy
10 min: Set up Gumroad, uploaded, published

Total cost: $0.025
Total time: 2 hours
First sale: 3 hours after launch

What I learned:
- Building is the easy part
- Marketing without distribution is hard
- Gumroad's discoverability is mid at best
- The $19 price point converts (at least once)

The template itself? It's a simple system for freelancers who juggle multiple clients and need to track who's paid, what's due, and where everything lives.

## 6. Reddit Launch (If You Ever Get An Account)

**r/freelance:**
```
[Tool] I built a Notion template for client/invoice tracking — trying to validate before I sink more time in

I'm a dev who went freelance and immediately lost track of who owed me what. Built this Notion system to manage clients, projects, and invoices.

It's $19 because I think that's what it's worth, but I'm honestly trying to gauge if people would pay for this sort of thing before I build more features.

Would love brutal honest feedback. What am I missing? What should I add? Should I even keep going?

```

**r/Notion:**
```
I built a freelance CRM in Notion (clients, projects, invoices, revenue tracking)

Been using this personally for 6 months. Finally cleaned it up and packaged it.

Features:
- Relational databases (clients → projects → invoices)
- Revenue dashboard with auto-calculations
- Invoice status tracking (sent/paid/overdue)
- Client lifetime value rollup
- + Canva invoice templates

$19 but I made a discount code REDDIT10 for 10% off because why not.

Criticism welcome — what else should this do?
