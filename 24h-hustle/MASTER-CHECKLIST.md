## STEP 3: Post to Reddit (15 minutes)

### Post 1: r/freelance
**Title:** Built a Notion template to stop losing track of client invoices — $19

**Body:**
```
Got tired of juggling 5+ clients in spreadsheets and forgetting who owed me money.

Built this Notion template with:
• Pre-loaded sample data (not blank — see it work immediately)
• Linked databases: Clients → Projects → Invoices
• Auto-calculating lifetime value per client
• 3 Canva invoice templates included

Setup takes 5 minutes. Not 5 hours.

Price: $19 (one time)

Buy if it saves you time. Roast me if it doesn't.

[Link in comments — not trying to spam]
```

**Comment with link:**
```
Link: [your Gumroad URL]

Real talk: This has pre-loaded sample data so you see exactly how it works before adding your info. Most templates are blank and confusing. This isn't.

Happy to answer questions!
```

### Post 2: r/Notion  
**Title:** Built a client management system for freelancers — looking for feedback

**Body:**
```
Made a Notion template specifically for freelancers tracking clients + invoices.

Features:
- 3 linked databases with relations
- Pre-loaded sample data (demo mode)
- Auto-calc lifetime value per client
- Kanban + Calendar views
- Invoice status tracking

Also threw in 3 Canva invoice templates because why not.

What do y'all think?

Good enough to charge $19, or should I make it free?

### Post 3: r/SideProject
**Title:** 24-hour challenge: Built a $19 product. Here's what happened.

**Body:**
```
Challenge: Ship something in 24 hours that solves a real problem.

Result: Freelancer client management template for $19

Why this problem?
• Freelancers lose $1000s forgetting to invoice
• Existing solutions are overbuilt or too simple
• Notion templates are usually blank and confusing

What I built:
• Notion template with 3 linked databases
• Pre-loaded sample data (big differentiator)
• 3 Canva invoice designs
• Total build time: 1.5 hours
• Total cost: $0.03 (AI thumbnail)

Launching in 1 hour. Will post results tomorrow.

If you're a freelancer: Would you pay $19 for this?

(Ruthless honesty welcome — this is a learning experiment)

## STEP 4: Respond to Comments (Ongoing)

**If someone asks for a discount:**
```
Use code "REDDIT10" for 10% off. Limited to first 10 people.
```

**If someone says it's too expensive:**
```
Fair point — what would you pay? Testing price sensitivity.
```

**If someone wants a feature:**
```
Great idea — adding to v2. DM me post-purchase and I'll prioritize it.
```

**If someone is skeptical:**
```
Totally fair. Here's the template preview — duplicate it and poke around first:

Then buy if you dig it. No hard feelings if you don't.
