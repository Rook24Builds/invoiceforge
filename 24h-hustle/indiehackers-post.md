# I built a freelance client management system in 2 hours for $0.025

## The Problem

Like most freelancers, I was juggling apps: Notion for notes, Google Sheets for invoices, random docs for contracts. It was a mess. Every month I'd spend 2-3 hours just organizing client info, chasing invoices, and trying to remember what project was where.

## The Solution

Built a simple Notion template with relational databases:
- **Clients** → **Projects** → **Invoices** (all linked)
- 3 Canva invoice templates for consistent branding
- Clean, minimal design that's actually usable

## The Build

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time | 2 hours |
| Cost | $0.025 (KIE.ai for thumbnail) |
| Tools | Notion (free), Canva (free), Gumroad (free) |

## The Launch

- Product: $19 on Gumroad
- Posted to Hacker News, Reddit, IndieHackers
- Goal: First sale validates the concept

## What I'd Do Differently

- Start with SEO keywords in the Gumroad listing
- Build an email capture before launch
- Create a demo video (converts better than screenshots)

## The Product

**Freelancer Command Center** — Notion template + invoice bundle
- https://rook24.gumroad.com/l/ugbkj

Built for freelancers who want to spend less time on admin and more time billing.
