## What Makes This Different

**Most Notion templates:** Give you blank pages to fill manually.

**INVOICEFORGE:** Starts with 5 realistic clients (SaaS, coaching, e-commerce, agency, non-profit). Shows you exactly how it works—then you add your own.

```
Sarah Chen (SaaS, $150/hr) → Landing Page Project → Invoice #001: $3,750
                                ↓                          ↓
                        Auto-calculated rates      PDF Export → Send
```
