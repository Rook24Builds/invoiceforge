# Reddit Infiltration Strategy - INVOICEFORGE

**Account:** u/Rook24Builds (created, needs karma before posting)

**Subreddit Targeting:**

## r/freelance (1.2M members)

**Value-First Comment Template:**
```
I track everything in Notion:

• Clients database (rate, contact info, payment terms)
• Projects linked to clients
• Invoices database that auto-calculates from hours × rate
• Status tracking (sent, paid, overdue)

Takes 60 seconds to generate an invoice. PDF export built-in.

No more spreadsheet math or copy-pasting between apps.

Happy to share the template structure if anyone's interested.
```

**If asked for link:**
```
I built it into a template with formulas pre-configured: [link]

$19 if you want the ready-to-use version. Or I can share the basic structure for free.
```

**Post Opportunities:**
- "What's your invoicing workflow?" → Comment with detailed how-to
- "How do you track billable hours?" → Share Notion method
- "Best tools for freelancers?" → Mention in comprehensive list

## r/Notion (800K members)

**Angle:** Show off the auto-calculating formulas

**Comment Template:**
```
I built an invoice generator with:

prop("Hours") * prop("Rate") for subtotal
prop("Subtotal") * prop("Tax Rate") for tax  
prop("Subtotal") + prop("Tax") for total

Then linked Clients → Projects → Invoices databases.

60-second invoicing from tracked hours. Game changer.
```

**Post Title Options:**
- "Built an auto-calculating invoice system in Notion - here's the formula"
- "From hours tracked to PDF invoice in 60 seconds"

## r/SaaS (500K members)

**Angle:** B2B tool validation, building in public

**Post Title:**
"Built a $19 product in 24h - validating if freelancers will pay for Notion templates"

## r/webdev (1.8M members)

**Angle:** Developers who freelance on the side

**Comment Template:**
```
As a dev who does freelance on the side, I got tired of:
1. Tracking hours in Notion
2. Copying to Google Sheets for math
3. Building invoice in Canva
4. Sending via Gmail

Built a Notion system that does steps 2-4 automatically.

Database formulas handle the math. Views show what's sent/paid/overdue.

One less context switch between code and admin.
```
