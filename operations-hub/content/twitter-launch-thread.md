# Twitter/X Launch Thread - INVOICEFORGE

**Tweet 1/5 - The Hook:**
```
My girlfriend spent 3 hours last night creating an invoice.

In Notion → Spreadsheet → Canva → Gmail.

I built her a system that does it in 60 seconds.

Here's INVOICEFORGE ⚡
```

**Tweet 2/5 - The Problem:**
```
Most freelancers juggle 5 apps to invoice:

• Notion for tracking
• Sheets for math  
• Canva for design
• Gmail to send
• Bank to check payment

That's 15 minutes per invoice.

Multiplied by 20 clients = 5 hours/month on admin.
```

**Tweet 3/5 - The Solution:**
```
INVOICEFORGE auto-generates from your Notion data:

→ Hours × Rate = Auto-calculated
→ Client info auto-fills
→ PDF export from Notion
→ Payment tracking built-in

One database. One workflow.
