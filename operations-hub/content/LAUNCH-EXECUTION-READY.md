## PLATFORM 1: TWITTER/X THREAD

**Tweet 1/5 - The Hook:**
```
My girlfriend spent 3 hours last night creating an invoice.

In Notion → Spreadsheet → Canva → Gmail.

I built her a system that does it in 60 seconds.

Here's INVOICEFORGE ⚡
```

**Tweet 2/5 - The Problem:**
```
Most freelancers juggle 5 apps to invoice:

• Notion for tracking
• Sheets for math  
• Canva for design
• Gmail to send
• Bank to check payment

That's 15 minutes per invoice.

Multiplied by 20 clients = 5 hours/month on admin.
```

**Tweet 3/5 - The Solution:**
```
INVOICEFORGE auto-generates from your Notion data:

→ Hours × Rate = Auto-calculated
→ Client info auto-fills
→ PDF export from Notion
→ Payment tracking built-in

One database. One workflow.

Demo: https://rook24builds.github.io/invoiceforge/
```

**Tweet 4/5 - Social Proof:**
```
Built in 24 hours for $0.05.

Pre-loaded with 5 sample clients so you see exactly how it works—then add your own.

No blank pages to stare at.

Just duplicate, explore, invoice.

⚡ INVOICEFORGE: Auto-Generate Invoices From Your Notion Data

I just spent 24 hours building something to solve a problem I see every freelancer face:

THE INVISIBLE ADMIN TAX

Most freelancers spend 15+ minutes per invoice copying data between:
→ Notion (project tracking)
→ Spreadsheets (calculations) 
→ Design tools (formatting)
→ Email (sending)
→ Bank (checking payment)

For 20 invoices/month, that's 5+ hours of non-billable work.

THE SOLUTION: INVOICEFORGE

A Notion system with pre-populated clients, auto-calculating formulas, and one-click PDF export.

✅ 5 sample clients included (see exactly how it works)
✅ Hours × Rate = Auto-calculated
✅ Tax, totals, balances auto-computed
✅ PDF export from Notion
✅ Payment tracking dashboard

Built for $0.05. Sells for $19.

The ROI math is simple:
• 2 invoices saved = pays for itself
• Every invoice after = time back for billable work

If you invoice clients monthly, this pays for itself in your first month.

Built in public over 24 hours.

Full transparency:
• 18 hours coding

The goal: Prove you don't need a following to launch—just a problem worth solving.

## PLATFORM 3: INDIE HACKERS

**Title:** "24-hour build complete: INVOICEFORGE 🚀"

**Category:** Product Launch

**Content:**
```
TL;DR: Built an auto-generating invoice system for Notion in 24h. Launched with $0 marketing budget.

THE PIVOT (Hour 18)

Started building "Freelancer Command Center" — an all-in-one Notion workspace.

Then I asked myself: "What's the one thing every freelancer does that wastes the most time?"

Answer: Creating invoices.

Not tracking hours. Not managing projects. The actual invoice creation.

So I pivoted. Dropped everything except invoicing. Doubled down.

Best decision of the build.

---

WHAT'S DIFFERENT

Most Notion templates give you blank pages.

INVOICEFORGE gives you 5 pre-populated clients with real data:
• Sarah Chen (SaaS, $150/hr)
• Marcus Johnson (Coaching, $120/hr)
• GreenLeaf Organics (E-commerce, $100/hr)
• Apex Marketing (Agency, $175/hr)
• Elena Ruiz (Non-profit, $80/hr)

You see exactly how it works—then delete and add your own.

No "figure it out" friction. Just instant understanding.

---

THE TECH

Auto-calculating formulas:
• Hours × Rate = Subtotal (auto)
• Subtotal × Tax Rate = Tax (auto)
• Subtotal + Tax = Total (auto)

Linked databases: Client → Project → Invoice

60-second workflow: Open → New → Select Client → Enter Hours → Export PDF → Send

---

THE NUMBERS

Build cost: $0.05 (KIE.ai images)
Time: 24 hours
Sales so far: 0
Marketing budget: $0

Why share zero sales?

Because that's where everyone starts.

The real measure isn't Day 1 revenue—it's whether you ship.

WHAT'S NEXT

24h builds every week until something sticks.

Next up: Client onboarding system (complement to invoicing)

## PLATFORM 4: REDDIT - COMMENT STRATEGY

### Target Subreddits:
1. r/freelance (1.2M members)
2. r/Notion (800K members) 
3. r/webdev (1.8M members)
4. r/SaaS (500K members)

### Comment Templates (use when relevant):

**r/freelance - Invoicing related topics:**
```
I track everything in Notion:

• Clients database (rate, contact info, payment terms)
• Projects linked to clients
• Invoices database that auto-calculates from hours × rate
• Status tracking (sent, paid, overdue)

Takes 60 seconds to generate an invoice. PDF export built-in.

No more spreadsheet math or copy-pasting between apps.

I built a template with this structure if anyone's interested.
```

**If asked for link:**
```
I turned it into a full template with pre-loaded clients and formulas: https://rook24.gumroad.com/l/invoiceforge

$19 if you want the ready-to-use version with 5 sample clients. The structure is simple enough to build yourself for free though, happy to share how if you want!
```

**r/Notion - Formula/Template posts:**
```
I built an invoice generator with:

prop("Hours") * prop("Rate") for subtotal
prop("Subtotal") * prop("Tax Rate") for tax  
prop("Subtotal") + prop("Tax") for total

Then linked Clients → Projects → Invoices databases.

60-second invoicing from tracked hours. Game changer.

Ended up building it into a full template for my freelance work.
```

**r/webdev - Freelance admin:**
```
As a dev who does freelance on the side, I got tired of:
1. Tracking hours in Notion
2. Copying to Google Sheets for math
3. Building invoice in Canva
4. Sending via Gmail

Built a Notion system that does steps 2-4 automatically.

Database formulas handle the math. Views show what's sent/paid/overdue.

One less context switch between code and admin.

Created a streamlined template if anyone wants to check it out: https://rook24builds.github.io/invoiceforge/
```

**r/SaaS - Building in Public:**
```
24h build challenge - just launched https://rook24.gumroad.com/l/invoiceforge

Auto-invoicing system for Notion. Built for $0.05, selling at $19.

Focus was on removing all friction:
- Pre-populated sample clients (no blank pages)
- All formulas pre-configured
- 60-second workflow

Validating if freelancers will pay for Notion templates vs building free alternatives.

Happy to share the build process if anyone's interested.
