⚡ INVOICEFORGE: Auto-Generate Invoices From Your Notion Data

I just spent 24 hours building something to solve a problem I see every freelancer face:

THE INVISIBLE ADMIN TAX

Most freelancers spend 15+ minutes per invoice copying data between:
→ Notion (project tracking)
→ Spreadsheets (calculations) 
→ Design tools (formatting)
→ Email (sending)
→ Bank (checking payment)

For 20 invoices/month, that's 5+ hours of non-billable work.

THE SOLUTION: INVOICEFORGE

A Notion system with pre-populated clients, auto-calculating formulas, and one-click PDF export.

✅ 5 sample clients included (see exactly how it works)
✅ Hours × Rate = Auto-calculated
✅ Tax, totals, balances auto-computed
✅ PDF export from Notion
✅ Payment tracking dashboard

Built for $0.05. Sells for $19.

The ROI math is simple:
• 2 invoices saved = pays for itself
• Every invoice after = time back for billable work

If you invoice clients monthly, this pays for itself in your first month.
