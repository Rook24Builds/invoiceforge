# 2026-02-27 - INVOICEFORGE Sample Data Fix

## Issue Discovered
START HERE page content promises:
- 5 sample clients
- 8 sample projects  
- 10 sample invoices
- 3 sample work log tasks

**ACTUAL counts in databases:**
- Clients: 2 (Creative Studio, Acme Corporation)
- Projects: 1 (Website Redesign)
- Invoices: ~2 with incomplete data
- Work Log: 3 ✅ (already correct)

## User Decision
User explicitly said: "add missing sample data" - wants to populate to match promises, NOT update content.

## API Problems
My PowerShell script failed because:
1. Wrong property names (using assumed schema vs actual)
2. Database ID format issues (Notion uses UUID with hyphens)
3. Need correct property names from actual database schema

## Next Steps (TBD)
- Need to query actual database schemas to get correct property names
- Or manually add samples via browser automation
- Or get correct database IDs via search endpoint

## Blocked
Can't proceed with API adds until schema is known. May need browser automation or manual assistance.

## Context
- INVOICEFORGE page ID: 31365823-28c7-81a1-9132-d659caf58fd7 (with hyphens)
- Integration may need re-share with databases
- User expects 5/8/10/3 counts to match README/START HERE content
