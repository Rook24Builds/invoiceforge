## INVOICEFORGE Build - Day 2

### Major Decisions

**Product Positioning Finalized**
- Price: $19 (template + working Make automation)
- Honest marketing: "Notion template + importable Make scenario" NOT "auto-generates invoices out of the box"
- Cut Canva templates (not a selling point, free anyway)
- Positioning: "Itemized billing. Auto-calculations. One-click PDF automation."

**Make.com Integration Actual Deliverable**
- Created `INVOICEFORGE-PDF-Generator.json` - importable scenario
- Created `MAKE-SCENARIO-SETUP.md` - 15-minute setup guide
- Buyer imports JSON → 15 min setup → PDF automation works
- This is REAL value, not just documentation

### Technical Progress

**Notion Database Enhancements**
- Added Tax Percent (number, percent format) to Invoices
- Added Tax (formula: prop("Amount") * prop("Tax Percent") / 100)
- Added PDF (files property) for generated PDFs
- All formulas working, relations linked

**Documentation Complete**
- `MAKE-SCENARIO-SETUP.md` - comprehensive guide
- `GUMROAD-LISTING.md` - honest sales copy
- `README.md` - accurate feature list
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

### Git/GitHub Status

**Secrets Management**
- GitHub blocked push due to secrets in commits
- User unblocked via GitHub web interface
- Committed `.gitignore` to prevent future issues
- **TODO: Rewrite git history later** to completely remove secrets
- **TODO: Regenerate Notion token** after history rewrite

**Repository**: https://github.com/Rook24Builds/invoiceforge
**Latest commit**: 8b2fe10 - "Add Make scenario JSON and updated docs"

### What's Included Now

### Key Insight
User called out the Canva template BS - forced me to focus on REAL value proposition: the importable Make scenario is the differentiator, not templates anyone can make for free.
